# TUI Development Changelog

## Session: October 21, 2025

### Summary

Completed implementation and debugging of the Terminal User Interface (TUI) for the Experiment Plotting Assistant. Fixed critical bugs, enhanced navigation, and created comprehensive documentation.

---

## Major Achievements

### 1. **Fixed Critical Plot Generation Bug** ✅

**Problem:** Plot generation screen froze at "Initializing... 0%" with no progress updates.

**Root Cause:** Using `self.call_from_thread()` instead of `self.app.call_from_thread()`
- `call_from_thread()` is a method of the **App** class, not Screen class
- This caused `AttributeError` in background thread
- Thread failed silently, never showing error to user

**Solution:**
```python
# BEFORE (broken):
self.call_from_thread(self._update_progress, 10, "Loading...")

# AFTER (fixed):
self.app.call_from_thread(self._update_progress, 10, "Loading...")
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/tui/screens/plot_generation.py` - All progress update calls

**Impact:** Plot generation now works perfectly with real-time progress updates.

---

### 2. **Fixed Navigation Issues** ✅

#### Issue A: Blank Screen After Clicking "Main Menu" or "Plot Another"

**Problem:** Buttons returned to a blank screen instead of main menu.

**Root Cause:** Popping too many screens from the stack
- Stack structure: `[Base(0), MainMenuScreen(1), ...wizard screens(2+)]`
- Was popping until `len(stack) > 1`, which removed MainMenuScreen
- Left only base screen (blank)

**Solution:**
```python
# BEFORE (broken):
while len(self.app.screen_stack) > 1:
    self.app.pop_screen()

# AFTER (fixed):
while len(self.app.screen_stack) > 2:
    self.app.pop_screen()
# Keeps Base(0) + MainMenuScreen(1)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/tui/screens/plot_generation.py` - Both success and error screens

---

#### Issue B: "Plot Another" Went to Main Menu Instead of Experiment Selector

**Problem:** Should jump to experiment selection for quick re-plotting, but went to main menu.

**Solution:** Enhanced `action_plot_another()` to:
1. Pass `chip_number`, `chip_group`, `plot_type` to success screen
2. Navigate directly to `ExperimentSelectorScreen` with same parameters
3. Allow quick workflow: Generate plot → Plot Another → Select different experiments → Generate

**Files Modified:**
- `src/tui/screens/plot_generation.py`:
  - Added parameters to `PlotSuccessScreen.__init__()`
  - Enhanced `action_plot_another()` with smart navigation
  - Updated `_on_success()` to pass parameters

**User Experience:**
```
Flow BEFORE:
  Success → Plot Another → Main Menu → Select chip → Select type → Select experiments

Flow AFTER:
  Success → Plot Another → Select experiments (same chip/type)
```

---

### 3. **Enhanced Focus Navigation** ✅

#### Issue: Preview Screen Buttons Not Keyboard Navigable

**Problem:** Arrow keys didn't move focus between buttons in preview screen.

**Root Causes:**
1. `Binding("enter", "generate", priority=True)` intercepted Enter key
2. No arrow key handler implemented

**Solution:**

**A. Removed blocking Enter binding:**
```python
# BEFORE:
BINDINGS = [
    Binding("escape", "back", "Back"),
    Binding("enter", "generate", "Generate", priority=True),  # ← Blocked focused button
]

# AFTER:
BINDINGS = [
    Binding("escape", "back", "Back"),
    # Removed Enter binding - let focused button handle it naturally
]
```

**B. Implemented custom arrow key navigation:**
```python
def on_key(self, event: events.Key) -> None:
    """Handle arrow key navigation between buttons."""
    buttons = [
        self.query_one("#back-button"),
        self.query_one("#generate-button"),
        self.query_one("#save-button"),
    ]

    # Find focused button
    focused_idx = next((i for i, b in enumerate(buttons) if b.has_focus), None)

    if focused_idx is not None:
        if event.key in ("left", "up"):
            new_idx = (focused_idx - 1) % len(buttons)
            buttons[new_idx].focus()
            event.prevent_default()
        elif event.key in ("right", "down"):
            new_idx = (focused_idx + 1) % len(buttons)
            buttons[new_idx].focus()
            event.prevent_default()
```

**C. Added visual focus indicators:**

**CSS styling:**
```css
.nav-button:focus {
    background: $primary;
    border: tall $accent;
    color: $primary-background;
    text-style: bold;
}
```

**Dynamic arrow labels:**
```python
def on_button_focus(self, event: Button.Focus) -> None:
    # Remove arrows from all buttons
    for button in self.query(".nav-button"):
        if button.label.startswith("→ "):
            button.label = button.label[2:]

    # Add arrow to focused button
    if not event.button.label.startswith("→ "):
        event.button.label = f"→ {event.button.label}"
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/tui/screens/preview_screen.py`

---

#### Issue: Generate Button Had Different Default Color

**Problem:** "Generate Plot" button was highlighted by default (used `variant="primary"`), making it visually inconsistent.

**Solution:** Changed to `variant="default"` so all buttons start with neutral color, only highlighted when focused.

```python
# BEFORE:
Button("Generate Plot", variant="primary", ...)

# AFTER:
Button("Generate Plot", variant="default", ...)
```

**Result:** All buttons now have uniform appearance until focused.

---

### 4. **Code Cleanup** ✅

#### Removed Debug Logging

After fixing the `call_from_thread` bug, removed all debug logging code:

```python
# REMOVED:
debug_log = open("plot_generation_debug.log", "w")
def log(msg):
    debug_log.write(f"{msg}\n")
    debug_log.flush()

log("[DEBUG] Thread started")
# ... 30+ debug log statements
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/tui/screens/plot_generation.py` - Clean, production-ready code

---

## Technical Learnings

### Textual Framework Insights

1. **Thread Safety**
   - ✅ `app.call_from_thread(callback, *args)` - Thread-safe UI updates
   - ❌ `screen.call_from_thread()` - Doesn't exist (AttributeError)
   - ❌ Direct UI updates from thread - Will crash

2. **Screen Stack Management**
   ```python
   # Stack structure:
   # [0] Base app screen (always present, never pop)
   # [1] MainMenuScreen (pushed in on_mount)
   # [2+] Wizard screens (push/pop as needed)

   # Return to main menu:
   while len(self.app.screen_stack) > 2:
       self.app.pop_screen()
   ```

3. **Focus System**
   - CSS `:focus` pseudo-class auto-applies when widget focused
   - `on_button_focus(event)` handler for dynamic label changes
   - `widget.has_focus` property to check current focus
   - `widget.focus()` to programmatically set focus

4. **Keyboard Event Handling**
   - `on_key(event)` receives all key events
   - `event.prevent_default()` stops propagation
   - `event.key` contains key name ("left", "enter", etc.)
   - Priority bindings can intercept keys before widgets

5. **Button Variants**
   - `"default"` - Neutral styling (gray/theme default)
   - `"primary"` - Highlighted (blue/theme primary)
   - `"error"` - Warning style (red)
   - Use `"default"` for uniform buttons, let `:focus` provide highlight

## Known Issues / Future Work

### Not Implemented Yet

1. **Cancellation** - "Escape" during plot generation shows notification but doesn't actually cancel
2. **Open File** - Button exists but not implemented (shows notification)
3. **Save & Exit** - Save config for later (shows notification)
4. **Recent Configurations** - Load previous plot configs
5. **Batch Mode** - Generate multiple plots at once
6. **Settings** - Configure paths, theme, defaults
7. **Help Screen** - In-app documentation viewer

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Experiment Selector:**
   - Search/filter functionality
   - Sort by columns
   - Pagination for 1000+ experiments
   - Column visibility toggle

2. **Plot Preview:**
   - Show thumbnail before generating
   - Allow parameter tweaking

3. **Progress:**
   - Time remaining estimation
   - Ability to cancel mid-generation

4. **Export:**
   - Save config to JSON
   - Command-line equivalent shown

5. **Mouse Support:**
   - Click buttons (currently keyboard-only)
   - Hover tooltips

---

## Performance Notes

- Plot generation runs in background thread (non-blocking)
- UI remains responsive during plotting
- Metadata loading is fast (<1s for 100s of experiments)
- Chip history building cached (future improvement)
