---

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. Plot Generation Freeze (FIXED ✅)

**Symptom**: Screen froze at "Initializing... 0%" with no progress

**Root Cause**: `self.call_from_thread()` vs `self.app.call_from_thread()`
- Used Screen method instead of App method
- Caused AttributeError in background thread
- Thread failed silently

**Fix**: Changed all calls to `self.app.call_from_thread()`

**Impact**: Plot generation now works perfectly with real-time updates

---

### 2. Navigation Issues (FIXED ✅)

**A. Blank Screen After "Main Menu"**

**Symptom**: Clicking "Main Menu" showed blank screen

**Root Cause**: Popped too many screens from stack
- Stack: `[Base(0), MainMenu(1), ...wizard(2+)]`
- Was popping until `len > 1`, which removed MainMenu

**Fix**: Pop until `len > 2` to keep Base + MainMenu

---

**B. "Plot Another" Went to Main Menu**

**Symptom**: Should go to experiment selector, went to main menu instead

**Root Cause**: Not passing chip/type info to success screen

**Fix**:
- Pass `chip_number`, `chip_group`, `plot_type` to success screen
- Navigate directly to `ExperimentSelectorScreen` with same parameters

**Impact**: Quick workflow now works: Success → Plot Another → Select experiments → Generate

---

### 3. Preview Screen Navigation (FIXED ✅)

**Symptom**: Arrow keys didn't move focus between buttons

**Root Cause**:
1. `Binding("enter", priority=True)` blocked focused button
2. No arrow key handler implemented

**Fix**:
1. Removed blocking Enter binding
2. Implemented `on_key()` handler for arrow navigation
3. Added CSS `:focus` styling
4. Added dynamic arrow labels (→)

**Impact**: Full keyboard navigation now works

---

### 4. Button Styling Inconsistency (FIXED ✅)

**Symptom**: "Generate Plot" button highlighted by default

**Root Cause**: Used `variant="primary"` instead of `variant="default"`

**Fix**: Changed all buttons to `variant="default"`

**Impact**: Uniform button appearance, only highlighted when focused

---

## User Experience Improvements

5. **Quick Workflow**
   - "Plot Another" for batch plotting
   - Preserves chip and plot type
   - Fast experiment re-selection

### Not Yet Implemented ❌

   - Different commands per OS (macOS/Linux/Windows)
   - Launch plot in default viewer

### Medium Priority (UX Improvements)

3. **Configuration Persistence** (Phase 3)
   - Implement `ConfigManager` class
   - JSON-based storage in `~/.lab_plotter_config.json`
   - Recent configurations screen
   - Load previous plot configs

4. **Settings Screen** (Phase 4)
   - Configure metadata_dir, raw_dir, output_dir
   - Set default chip_group
   - Theme selection
   - Max recent configs

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

5. **Batch Mode** (Phase 4)

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use (Production)

**The TUI is ready for lab use with the following caveats:**

✅ **USE IT FOR:**
- Quick plot generation (all types)
- Interactive experiment selection
- Exploring available chips
- Learning experiment workflow

❌ **DON'T EXPECT:**
- Configuration saving (must re-enter each time)
- Batch plotting multiple chips
- Settings customization
- In-app help

**Workaround**: For repeated plots, use CLI or notebook instead of TUI

---

### For Future Development

**Priority order:**
1. **Quick wins** (1-2 hours each):
   - Cancellation functionality
   - Open file in viewer

2. **Medium effort** (1 day each):
   - Configuration persistence (Phase 3)
   - Settings screen

3. **Large effort** (2-3 days):
   - Batch mode implementation
   - Full custom config screens for all types

**Timeline estimate**:
- Quick wins: 1 day
- Phase 3 complete: 2-3 days
- Phase 4 complete: 5-7 days
- Phase 5 complete (all polish): 8-10 days

---

## Conclusion

### Summary

The TUI has successfully completed **Phases 1 & 2**, providing a fully functional wizard for plot generation. All core features are working, and the application is stable and production-ready for daily use.

### Key Achievements

✅ Complete wizard flow (7 screens)
✅ All plot types supported
✅ Full keyboard navigation
✅ Real-time progress tracking
✅ Excellent error handling
✅ Quick workflow optimization
✅ Production-quality documentation

### Remaining Work
